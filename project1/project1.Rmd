**Decision variables:**  
(x1), ... , (x10) amount of each bond  
(z1), ... , (z7) excess cash at the end of each year (excluding the excess cash at the last period)  

**Minimize:** 102(x1) + 99(x2) + 101(x3) + 98(x4) + 98(x5) + 104(x6) + 100(x7) + 101(x8) + 102(x9) + 94(x10)
 cost of each bond

**Subject to:**  
 year 1: 12000 = 100(x1) + 5(x1) + 3.5(x2) + 5(x3) + 3.5(x4) + 4(x5) + 9(x6) + 6(x7) + 8(x8) + 9(x9) + 7(x10) - (z1)

The matrix below specifies how much of each bond the portfolio should consist of. The last 11 variables are the z variables which represent excess cash carried over each year. They indicate that approximately $4.7M should be carried over from period 10 to 11.
```{r}
get.variables(new_port)
```

The cost of the portfolio is $74,042,228, which equates to $21,957,772 in savings (ignoring interest/time value of money).
```{r}
get.objective(new_port)
```
  
Finally, we plot and interpret the sensitivity parameters of the dedicated portfolio.
```{r}
# plotting bond and liability duals versus libability period (analagous to date)
duals = get.dual.solution(new_port)
sensitivity = get.sensitivity.rhs(new_port)
dual_df = data.frame(sensitivity$duals,sensitivity$dualsfrom,sensitivity$dualstill)

liab_duals = dual_df[1:12,]
bond_duals = dual_df[13:236,]
```

```{r}
plot(m, bond_duals$sensitivity.duals, main="Bond Duals by Maturity Period")
```

The graph above shows the shadow prices for each of the 224 bonds by maturity period. The shadow price represents the increase in the objective value (cost of the portfolio) from a purchase of an additional bond. We see a positive relationship between maturity period and the duals, such that buying additional bonds with later maturity dates has a greater impact on the total portfolio cost than buying bonds with shorter term maturities.

This makes sense, because the further into the future a bond matures, the more coupons it will generate and the more expensive it is. For example, bond #1 has a maturity of 2/15/2016 and a shadow price of 8.05. This means buying an additional unit of bond 1 would increase the objective value by 8.05. Buying an additional bond that matures in a later period would increase the objective value by a greater amount.
```{r}
plot(c(1:12), liab_duals$sensitivity.duals, main="Liability Duals by Maturity Period")
```

Looking at liability duals by maturity shows a negative relationship. The first liability has a shadow price of 0.92, which means that an increase in the first liability by $1 requires a $0.92 increase in the objective value, or cost of the portfolio. Shadow prices fall as maturity dates rise because there is more time to accumulate return to cover the liability.

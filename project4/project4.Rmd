To minimize cost, the store should have 15 counters open for black friday. The estimated cost is inidicated below under min(total_cost).
  
Cost was calculated using the formula: Overall Cost = [$1 X (Customers with Wait Time > 10)] +[$40/60 X No. Of minutes all counters are open]

With 1 queue, the optimal number of counters is lower at 13. The estimated cost is inidicated below under min(cost_all). This tells us that 1 queue is more efficient than multiple queues with random selection.

The optimal number of counter for a multiple queuing system with shortest queue selection is 13, lower than it was with random selection. The cost is show below under min(cost_all) This makes sense because it is more efficient for customers to choose the shortest queue.
